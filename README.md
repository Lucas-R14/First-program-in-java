# First-program-in-java

 --> Main: A program that ask the user's name and age.

 --> How I made it: 

 - I created a scanner object to scan the varibles more after in the program.

 - Made an output with "Systen.out.println()" to show the user's what the program is asking for.
 
 -Utilizes the scanner object to make an input with the informations asked.
 
 -Finish the program showing a short text with the name and the age entered before.
